#+TITLE: SFML Game Prototype C++
#+AUTHOR: Oleksandr Kononov

This is a CA assignment for the C++ Game Development Module. The assignment consists of creating a game prototype in C++ using the
[[https://www.sfml-dev.org/][SFML Library]].

** Aspects/Features

The Game Prototype will contain the following:

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system][Entity-Component System Pattern]]
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight_pattern][Flyweight Design Pattern]]
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern][Command Pattern]]
- [[https://www.redblobgames.com/x/1510-influence-maps/][Influence Maps]]

** Current Status
Currently the Entity-Component System Pattern is built and in use on both the EvilPlayer and Player.\\
The Flyweight Design Pattern is already implemented with the Asset Manager, but also seen in the Command Pattern.\\
The influence map is used via a library, and so far is working on both enemy and player to show Red(positive influence) and Blue(negative influence) respectively.\\
